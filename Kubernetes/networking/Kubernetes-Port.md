### **Kubernetes Port Concepts in Depth**:

---

### 1. **Port in Service**  
In Kubernetes, a **service** abstracts and exposes an application running inside a **pod** to the outside world. It provides networking rules for traffic routing to different **pods**.

- **`port`**:  
  - This is the port on which the **service** listens to external traffic.  
  - This is the port that **clients** use to access the service from outside the Kubernetes cluster.  
  - **Example**:  
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: myapp-service
    spec:
      ports:
        - port: 80  # Exposed port for external access
          targetPort: 8080  # Target port inside the container
    ```
    - **`port: 80`**: The port on the service externally (clients access via this port).
    - **`targetPort: 8080`**: The port inside the **container** where traffic is forwarded.

---

### 2. **TargetPort in Service**  
- **`targetPort`**:  
  - This is the **port inside the container** (pod) where the actual application listens.  
  - When external traffic arrives at the **service**, Kubernetes forwards it to this port inside the **container**.  
- **Example**:  
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: myapp-service
  spec:
    ports:
      - port: 80  # Service will listen on port 80 externally
        targetPort: 8080  # Traffic will be forwarded to port 8080 inside the container
  ```
  - **`targetPort: 8080`**: The port in the container where traffic should be sent to (where the application runs).

---

### 3. **Port in Deployment**  
In **Deployment** templates, you define how your application runs inside **pods**.  
- **`port`**:  
  - This is the **port** that **external services** can use to reach the application. It is the port through which **services** (including `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`) expose your **pods** to the network.  
  - **Example**:  
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: myapp-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: myapp-container
              image: myapp-image
              ports:
                - port: 80  # This port is exposed to the service for external access
                  containerPort: 8080  # This port inside the container
    ```
  - **`port: 80`**: The port that the **deployment** exposes to external services. This is the **service port**.

### 4. **containerPort in Deployment**  
- **`containerPort`**:  
  - This is the **port inside the container** where your application is running.  
  - **Example**:  
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: myapp-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: myapp-container
              image: myapp-image
              ports:
                - containerPort: 8080  # The port inside the container where the application listens
                  port: 80  # Port exposed by the service
    ```
  - **`containerPort: 8080`**: This is the port inside the **container** where the application is listening and handling requests.

---

### 5. **How They Work Together**:
- **Port** in **Service**:  
  - The **port** is what the **external clients** use to access the service.  
  - Example: Clients outside the cluster send requests to `80` and Kubernetes routes it to the internal **container** port `8080`.
  
- **TargetPort** in **Service**:  
  - The **targetPort** forwards the traffic from the service to the **container**. This is where the actual workload runs inside the pod.

- **port** in **Deployment**:  
  - This is the **port exposed** by your **pods** to external services. This is the port **external clients** will use to reach your application.

- **containerPort** in **Deployment**:  
  - This is the **port inside the container** where the application handles requests.

### **Diagram Representation**:
```
Cluster
  ├── Namespace
  │   ├── Deployment
  │   │   ├── Pods
  │   │   │   ├── Container (containerPort: 8080)
  │   └── Service
      ├── Port (80) --> This is the external port clients connect to
      └── TargetPort (8080) --> This is the port inside the container
```

---

### **Conclusion**:
- **Port** (in Service): The external port clients connect to.
- **TargetPort** (in Service): The internal container port where traffic is sent to.
- **port** (in Deployment): The port exposed by the pods to external services.
- **containerPort** (in Deployment): The port inside the container where your application runs.
