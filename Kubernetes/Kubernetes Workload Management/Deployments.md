# Kubernetes Deployment Deep Notes

## What is a Kubernetes Deployment?
A Deployment in Kubernetes is a resource used to manage a set of Pods to run an application workload. Deployments are particularly suited for stateless applications, where no persistent data needs to be retained between sessions.

Deployments provide declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. This means you describe the desired state of your application in a Deployment object, and Kubernetes ensures the actual state matches the desired state at a controlled rate.

---

## Key Features of Deployments

1. **Declarative Updates**
   - You specify the desired state (e.g., the number of replicas, container image version, resource limits) in the Deployment YAML file.
   - Kubernetes ensures the actual state aligns with the desired state by creating or updating resources as needed.

2. **Self-Healing**
   - If a Pod in a Deployment fails, Kubernetes automatically replaces it to maintain the desired number of replicas.

3. **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks**
   - A Deployment supports rolling updates, which incrementally update Pods to the new version without downtime.
   - In case of failure, you can easily rollback to a previous version.

4. **Version Control for ReplicaSets**
   - Deployments manage ReplicaSets, which in turn manage the Pods. 
   - Each new Deployment creates a new ReplicaSet, enabling rollbacks to prior versions if needed.

5. **Scaling**
   - You can scale Deployments up or down by adjusting the number of replicas to handle varying levels of workload.

## Components of a Deployment

1. **Deployment Spec**
   - Defines the desired state of the application, including:
     - Number of replicas
     - Pod template (e.g., containers, images, labels)
     - Update strategy (e.g., RollingUpdate or Recreate)

2. **ReplicaSet**
   - Automatically created and managed by the Deployment.
   - Ensures the specified number of Pods are running.

3. **Pods**
   - The actual units of work that run your containerized application.
   - Created and maintained by the ReplicaSet.

---

## Deployment Lifecycle

1. **Creation**
   - Define the Deployment in a YAML file and apply it using `kubectl apply -f <file>.yaml`.
   - Example YAML:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: example-deployment
     spec:
       replicas: 3
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: example
       template:
         metadata:
           labels:
             app: example
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: example-container
             image: nginx:1.23.3
             ports:
             - containerPort: 80
     ```

2. **Update**
   - Modify the Deployment YAML to change the desired state (e.g., new image version) and reapply it.
   - Kubernetes will perform a rolling update to replace Pods incrementally.

3. **Scaling**
   - Adjust the `replicas` field in the Deployment YAML or use the command:
     ```bash
     kubectl scale deployment/example-deployment --replicas=5
     ```

4. **Rollback**
   - If an update fails, you can rollback to a previous revision using:
     ```bash
     kubectl rollout undo deployment/example-deployment
     ```

5. **Deletion**
   - Use `kubectl delete deployment/example-deployment` to remove the Deployment and its associated resources.

## Use Cases for Deployments

The following are typical use cases for Deployments:

1. **Rolling Out a ReplicaSet**
   - Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet, in turn, creates Pods in the background.
   - Check the status of the rollout using the command:
     ```bash
     kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment-name>
     ```
   - This ensures the Pods are running successfully as per the desired configuration.

2. **Declarative Updates for Pods**
   - Declare a new state for your Pods by modifying the `PodTemplateSpec` of the Deployment.
   - A new ReplicaSet is automatically created, and Kubernetes manages the transition of Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled pace.
   - Each update increases the Deployment revision, enabling easy tracking and rollback.

3. **Rollback to a Stable Revision**
   - If the current state of the Deployment is unstable or fails, rollback to a previous stable version.
   - Use the command:
     ```bash
     kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name>
     ```
   - Each rollback also updates the revision history, maintaining consistency.

4. **Scaling Up or Down**
   - Scale the Deployment to accommodate changes in workload by adjusting the replica count.
   - This ensures your application can handle varying traffic without manual intervention.

5. **Pausing a Rollout**
   - Pause a rollout to apply multiple changes to the `PodTemplateSpec` without triggering a new rollout for every change.
   - Pause the Deployment using:
     ```bash
     kubectl rollout pause deployment/<deployment-name>
     ```
   - Resume the rollout once all changes are made using:
     ```bash
     kubectl rollout resume deployment/<deployment-name>
     ```

6. **Monitoring Rollouts**
   - Use the status of the Deployment to detect issues like a stuck rollout.
   - If a rollout is stuck, debug the Deployment by inspecting events and logs to identify the problem.

7. **Cleaning Up Old ReplicaSets**
   - Over time, older ReplicaSets may no longer be needed. These can be cleaned up manually or by configuring the `revisionHistoryLimit` in the Deployment spec.
   - This helps in conserving resources and maintaining a clean environment.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Labels and Selectors**
   - Clearly label Pods and ReplicaSets to ensure Deployments manage the correct resources.

2. **Set Resource Limits**
   - Define `resources.requests` and `resources.limits` to prevent resource exhaustion.

3. **Monitor Rollouts**
   - Use `kubectl rollout status deployment/<name>` to monitor the progress of updates.

4. **Enable Probes**
   - Configure readiness and liveness probes to ensure Pods are healthy before serving traffic.

5. **Keep Revisions in Check**
   - Limit the number of historical revisions stored by setting `revisionHistoryLimit` in the Deployment spec.
