---

## üß† What Are Static Pods?

Static Pods are a unique type of pod in Kubernetes that are managed directly by the **Kubelet** on a specific node, bypassing the need for the Kubernetes API server, controller manager, scheduler, or etcd. Unlike regular pods, which are orchestrated by the control plane, static pods are defined locally via YAML or JSON manifest files and are ideal for scenarios where a full Kubernetes cluster isn‚Äôt available or needed.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Node-Specific**: Static pods are tied to the node where their manifest files reside.
- **Independent Operation**: They can run without a functional Kubernetes control plane, making them critical for bootstrapping or standalone environments.
- **Self-Healing**: Kubelet monitors and restarts static pods if they crash or fail health checks.
- **Use Case**: Primarily used to deploy control plane components (e.g., `kube-apiserver`, `etcd`) or for running pods on isolated nodes.

---

## üö¢ Kubelet as an Independent Agent

The **Kubelet** is a node-level agent that can operate independently, even in the absence of a Kubernetes cluster. It can manage containers (via a container runtime like containerd or Docker) using static pod manifests, making it a powerful tool for bootstrapping or running pods in minimal setups.

### Analogy:
Imagine the Kubelet as a ship‚Äôs captain stranded without communication to the mainland (API server). It can still operate the ship (node) and launch lifeboats (static pods) using local instructions (manifest files).

### Why This Matters:
- Static pods enable Kubernetes to bootstrap itself, especially during cluster initialization with tools like `kubeadm`.
- They allow for standalone node operation in edge computing or testing scenarios.

---

## üîÅ How Does the Kubelet Know What to Run?

The Kubelet monitors a designated directory for pod manifest files (YAML or JSON) and acts based on changes in that directory. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Manifest Directory**: The Kubelet is configured with a directory path (via `--pod-manifest-path` or a config file) where pod manifests are stored.
2. **Monitoring Behavior**:
   - **Create**: When a new manifest file is added, Kubelet creates the corresponding pod.
   - **Update**: If a manifest file is modified, Kubelet restarts the pod with the updated configuration.
   - **Delete**: If a manifest file is removed, Kubelet deletes the associated pod.
   - **Crash Recovery**: If a pod crashes, Kubelet automatically restarts it based on the manifest.

### Example Workflow:
1. You place a file named `nginx-pod.yaml` in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`.
2. Kubelet detects the file, creates an Nginx pod, and manages its lifecycle.
3. If you edit `nginx-pod.yaml` (e.g., change the image version), Kubelet recreates the pod.
4. If you delete `nginx-pod.yaml`, Kubelet terminates the pod.

---

## üìÅ Where Are Static Pod Manifests Stored?

The default directory for static pod manifests is typically:

```
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/
```

This path is configured in one of two ways:
1. **Directly via Kubelet Flags**:
   - The `--pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests` flag is passed to the Kubelet in its systemd service file (e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service`).
2. **Via Kubelet Config File**:
   - A Kubelet configuration file (specified with `--config`) includes a field like:
     ```yaml
     staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests
     ```

### Important Notes:
- The directory is **local to the node** and monitored only by the Kubelet, not the API server.
- Any valid pod manifest (YAML or JSON) placed in this directory is processed by the Kubelet.
- The directory must be accessible and writable by the Kubelet process (check permissions).

## üß± Bootstrapping the Control Plane with Static Pods

When initializing a Kubernetes cluster with `kubeadm`, static pods are used to deploy the core control plane components:
- `kube-apiserver`
- `kube-controller-manager`
- `kube-scheduler`
- `etcd`

### How It Works:
1. During `kubeadm init`, manifest files for these components are generated and placed in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`.
2. The Kubelet on the control plane node reads these manifests and starts the components as static pods.
3. Once the `kube-apiserver` is running, it becomes available, and the Kubelet registers these static pods as **mirror pods** in the API server.
4. Mirror pods are read-only reflections of static pods, visible in the `kube-system` namespace.

### Example Manifest (Simplified `kube-apiserver`):
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kube-apiserver
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  containers:
  - name: kube-apiserver
    image: k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver:v1.29.0
    command:
    - kube-apiserver
    - --advertise-address=192.168.1.10
    - --etcd-servers=http://127.0.0.1:2379
    volumeMounts:
    - name: certs
      mountPath: /etc/kubernetes/pki
  volumes:
  - name: certs
    hostPath:
      path: /etc/kubernetes/pki
```

This manifest allows the Kubelet to run `kube-apiserver` independently, enabling the cluster to bootstrap.

## üîç Visibility of Static Pods

Once the Kubernetes API server is operational, static pods appear as **mirror pods** in the `kube-system` namespace. You can view them with:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

### Key Details:
- **Naming Convention**: Mirror pods have the node name appended (e.g., `kube-apiserver-node01`).
- **Read-Only Nature**: You cannot modify or delete mirror pods using `kubectl`. Changes must be made to the manifest files in the static pod directory.
- **Cluster Integration**: Mirror pods allow the API server to track static pods without managing them.

### Example Output:
```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
etcd-master01                   1/1     Running   0          1h
kube-apiserver-master01         1/1     Running   0          1h
kube-controller-manager-master01 1/1     Running   0          1h
kube-scheduler-master01         1/1     Running   0          1h
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Static Pods Work (Mechanics)

The Kubelet‚Äôs interaction with static pods is purely file-based and local. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown:

| **Operation**      | **Trigger**                          | **Action Taken by Kubelet**                     |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Create Pod**     | New manifest file added             | Kubelet creates the pod based on the manifest.  |
| **Update Pod**     | Manifest file modified              | Kubelet restarts the pod with the new config.   |
| **Delete Pod**     | Manifest file removed               | Kubelet deletes the corresponding pod.          |
| **Crash Recovery** | Pod container crashes               | Kubelet restarts the pod per the manifest.     |

### Technical Notes:
- The Kubelet polls the manifest directory periodically (default: every 20 seconds).
- It uses the container runtime (e.g., containerd, CRI-O) to manage the pod‚Äôs containers.
- No network calls to the API server are required, ensuring resilience in disconnected environments.

---

## üîÅ Kubelet Input Types

The Kubelet can manage pods from two sources:
1. **Static Pod Files**:
   - Defined in the manifest directory.
   - Processed locally without API server involvement.
2. **API Server**:
   - Pods created via `kubectl` or controllers (e.g., Deployments, DaemonSets).
   - Requires a functional control plane.

The Kubelet seamlessly handles both static and API-managed pods, prioritizing local manifests for static pods.

---

## üìé Static Pods vs. DaemonSets

Static pods and DaemonSets both ensure pods run on specific nodes, but they serve different purposes:

| **Feature**                    | **Static Pods**                              | **DaemonSets**                              |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Created By**                 | Kubelet (local)                            | DaemonSet Controller (via API server)      |
| **API Server Required?**       | ‚ùå No                                      | ‚úÖ Yes                                     |
| **Scheduler Involved?**        | ‚ùå No                                      | ‚ùå No (DaemonSet controller handles placement) |
| **Used for Control Plane?**    | ‚úÖ Yes                                     | ‚ùå No                                      |
| **Deployment Method**          | YAML/JSON in manifest directory            | `kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml`          |
| **Editable via kubectl?**      | ‚ùå No (read-only mirror pods)              | ‚úÖ Yes                                     |
| **Cluster Awareness**          | ‚ùå Local to node                           | ‚úÖ Cluster-wide                            |

### When to Use Each:
- **Static Pods**: For bootstrapping control plane components or running pods on nodes without a control plane (e.g., edge devices).
- **DaemonSets**: For cluster-wide services like logging agents (e.g., Fluentd) or monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus node exporter).

---

## ‚úÖ Summary: Why Use Static Pods?

Static pods are a cornerstone of Kubernetes‚Äô flexibility and resilience, enabling:
- **Control Plane Bootstrapping**: Deploy critical components like `kube-apiserver` and `etcd` without an existing cluster.
- **Isolated Node Operation**: Run pods on standalone nodes in edge or disconnected environments.
- **Testing and Simulation**: Experiment with Kubernetes behavior without a full cluster.
- **Reliability**: Kubelet ensures self-healing and automatic restarts.

### Advantages:
- **Simplicity**: No dependency on a central control plane.
- **Resilience**: Operates in degraded or offline scenarios.
- **Self-Healing**: Kubelet monitors and manages pod lifecycle.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On: YAML Demo for Static Pods

Here‚Äôs a practical example to create a static pod running an Nginx web server.

### 1. Create a Static Pod Manifest
Save the following YAML as `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/nginx-pod.yaml` on your node:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-static
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.25
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

### 2. Configure Kubelet
Ensure the Kubelet is configured to monitor the manifest directory. Check the systemd service file:

```bash
$ cat /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/kubelet --pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests ...
```

If using a config file, verify:

```bash
$ cat /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.yaml
staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests
```

### 3. Apply and Verify
1. Place the `nginx-pod.yaml` file in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`.
2. Kubelet automatically creates the pod.
3. Check the pod status:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-static-<nodename>  1/1     Running   0          10s
```

4. Test access (assuming the node is reachable):

```bash
$ curl <node-ip>:80
```

### 4. Modify or Delete
- Edit `nginx-pod.yaml` (e.g., change the image to `nginx:1.26`) and save. Kubelet will restart the pod.
- Delete `nginx-pod.yaml` from the directory, and Kubelet will remove the pod.

## üß™ Simulating a Control Plane with Static Pods

To simulate a control plane setup using static pods on a single node:

1. **Install Kubelet and Container Runtime**:
   - Install `kubelet` and a runtime like `containerd` or `Docker`.
   - Example (Ubuntu):
     ```bash
     apt-get install -y kubelet containerd
     ```

2. **Configure Kubelet**:
   - Set `--pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests` in `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service`.
   - Reload and start Kubelet:
     ```bash
     systemctl daemon-reload
     systemctl restart kubelet
     ```

3. **Create Control Plane Manifests**:
   - Manually create manifests for `etcd`, `kube-apiserver`, etc., in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`.
   - Example `etcd` manifest:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: etcd
       namespace: kube-system
     spec:
       containers:
       - name: etcd
         image: k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.5.12
         command:
         - etcd
         - --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd
         volumeMounts:
         - name: etcd-data
           mountPath: /var/lib/etcd
       volumes:
       - name: etcd-data
         hostPath:
           path: /var/lib/etcd
     ```

4. **Verify**:
   - Check pod status with `crictl` (since no API server is running):
     ```bash
     crictl pods
     ```
   - Once `kube-apiserver` is running, use `kubectl` to verify mirror pods.
