## Deep Notes on Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes

### 1. Introduction to Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
The **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** is a Kubernetes controller that automatically adjusts the number of Pods in a workload (e.g., Deployment, ReplicaSet, or StatefulSet) based on observed resource utilization or custom metrics. It is designed to ensure that an application can handle varying levels of demand without manual intervention, improving scalability and resource efficiency.

#### Purpose of HPA
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically increases or decreases the number of Pods to match application demand.
- **Resource Optimization**: Ensures resources are used efficiently by scaling down when demand is low.
- **Resilience**: Handles sudden traffic spikes without requiring constant monitoring by administrators.
- **Exam Relevance**: HPA is a key topic in the CKA exam, requiring knowledge of its configuration, dependencies, and troubleshooting.

---

### 2. Manual Scaling vs. Automated Scaling
To understand HPA, it’s helpful to first explore the manual approach to scaling workloads, as described in the transcript.

#### Manual Horizontal Scaling
- **Scenario**: A Kubernetes administrator monitors a cluster to ensure sufficient Pods are available to handle application demand.
- **Pod Configuration Example**:
  - A Pod in a Deployment requests **250m CPU** (0.25 CPU cores) and has a limit of **500m CPU** (0.5 CPU cores).
  - The limit (500m CPU) is the maximum CPU the Pod can consume before being throttled.
- **Monitoring Process**:
  - Use the `kubectl top pod` command to monitor CPU/memory usage of Pods.
  - Requires the **Metrics Server** to be running in the cluster to provide resource usage data.
- **Scaling Action**:
  - When CPU usage approaches a defined threshold (e.g., 450m CPU), the administrator manually scales the Deployment by adding more Pods.
  - Command: `kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=<number>`
  - Example:
    ```bash
    kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=5
    ```
    This increases the number of Pods to 5 to handle the increased load.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Constant Monitoring**: Requires continuous observation of resource usage (e.g., via `kubectl top`).
  - **Manual Intervention**: Scaling commands must be executed manually, which is time-consuming.
  - **Slow Reaction Time**: Sudden traffic spikes may not be addressed quickly enough, leading to performance issues.
  - **Human Error**: Manual processes are prone to mistakes or delays (e.g., during breaks or off-hours).

#### Automated Scaling with HPA
- **What It Does**:
  - Automates the monitoring and scaling process by continuously polling resource usage metrics (e.g., CPU, memory) or custom metrics.
  - Adjusts the number of Pods in a workload to maintain a target metric threshold (e.g., 50% CPU utilization).
  - Scales up (adds Pods) when resource usage exceeds the threshold and scales down (removes Pods) when usage drops.
- **Benefits**:
  - Eliminates the need for constant manual monitoring.
  - Responds quickly to traffic spikes or drops, improving application reliability.
  - Optimizes resource usage by scaling down during low demand, reducing costs in cloud environments.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Metrics Server**: Provides resource usage data (CPU, memory) for Pods.
  - **HPA Controller**: Part of the Kubernetes control plane, monitors metrics and adjusts replicas.
  - **Workload Resources**: Targets Deployments, ReplicaSets, or StatefulSets for scaling.

---

### 3. How HPA Works
The HPA operates as a control loop that periodically checks resource utilization or other metrics and adjusts the number of Pods accordingly.

#### Workflow
1. **Metric Collection**:
   - The HPA queries the Metrics Server (or other metric sources) to retrieve resource usage data for the target workload’s Pods.
   - Example: Monitors CPU usage across all Pods in a Deployment.
2. **Comparison to Threshold**:
   - Compares current metric values (e.g., average CPU utilization) to the target threshold (e.g., 50% CPU).
   - Formula for desired replicas:
     ```
     Desired Replicas = Current Replicas * (Current Metric Value / Target Metric Value)
     ```
     Example: If current CPU usage is 75%, target is 50%, and current replicas are 4:
     ```
     Desired Replicas = 4 * (75 / 50) = 4 * 1.5 = 6
     ```
     The HPA scales to 6 Pods.
3. **Scaling Action**:
   - Updates the `replicas` field in the target workload (e.g., Deployment) to add or remove Pods.
   - Ensures the number of replicas stays within the defined `minReplicas` and `maxReplicas` bounds.
4. **Stabilization**:
   - Includes a stabilization window to prevent rapid, unnecessary scaling (e.g., avoids scaling down immediately after scaling up).

#### Supported Metrics
- **Resource Metrics** (Default):
  - CPU utilization (percentage of requested CPU).
  - Memory utilization (percentage of requested memory).
- **Custom Metrics**:
  - Application-specific metrics (e.g., requests per second, queue length) provided by a custom metrics adapter (e.g., Prometheus).
- **External Metrics**:
  - Metrics from external systems outside the cluster (e.g., Datadog, Dynatrace) via an external metrics adapter.
  - Example: Scaling based on the number of messages in an external message queue.

#### Dependencies
- **Metrics Server**:
  - A cluster-wide component that collects resource usage data (CPU, memory) from Pods and nodes.
  - Required for HPA to function with resource metrics.
  - Installation:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
    ```
  - Verify:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metrics-server
    kubectl top pods
    ```
- **Custom/External Metrics** (Optional):
  - Requires a custom metrics adapter (e.g., Prometheus Adapter) or external metrics provider (e.g., Datadog).
  - Beyond the scope of the CKA exam but useful for advanced use cases.

### 4. Configuring HPA
HPA can be configured using either **imperative** or **declarative** approaches. Both methods are important for the CKA exam.

#### Imperative Approach
- **Command**: `kubectl autoscale`
- **Purpose**: Quickly create an HPA for a workload without writing a YAML file.
- **Syntax**:
  ```bash
  kubectl autoscale deployment <deployment-name> --min=<min-replicas> --max=<max-replicas> --cpu-percent=<target-percentage>
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  kubectl autoscale deployment my-app --min=1 --max=10 --cpu-percent=50
  ```
  - Creates an HPA for the `my-app` Deployment.
  - Scales between 1 and 10 Pods to maintain 50% CPU utilization.
  - Assumes Pods have a CPU limit (e.g., 500m CPU) defined in the Deployment spec.
- **How It Works**:
  - Kubernetes creates an HPA resource that monitors CPU usage via the Metrics Server.
  - Scales the Deployment up/down when CPU usage exceeds/falls below 50% of the requested CPU.
- **Verification**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get hpa
  ```
  Output example:
  ```
  NAME         REFERENCE             TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
  my-app-hpa   Deployment/my-app     30%/50%   1         10        3          5m
  ```
  - **TARGETS**: Shows current CPU usage (30%) vs. target (50%).
  - **REPLICAS**: Current number of Pods (3).
- **Deletion**:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete hpa my-app-hpa
  ```

#### Declarative Approach
- **Purpose**: Define the HPA configuration in a YAML file for reproducibility and version control.
- **Example YAML**:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
  kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
  metadata:
    name: my-app-hpa
  spec:
    scaleTargetRef:
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      name: my-app
    minReplicas: 1
    maxReplicas: 10
    metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 50
  ```
- **Key Fields**:
  - `scaleTargetRef`: Specifies the workload to scale (e.g., Deployment named `my-app`).
  - `minReplicas`: Minimum number of Pods (e.g., 1).
  - `maxReplicas`: Maximum number of Pods (e.g., 10).
  - `metrics`: Defines the metric to monitor (e.g., CPU utilization at 50%).
- **Apply the HPA**:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f hpa.yaml
  ```
- **Verification**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get hpa
  kubectl describe hpa my-app-hpa
  ```
- **Deletion**:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete -f hpa.yaml
  ```

#### Example Pod Configuration
For HPA to work effectively, the target workload’s Pods must have resource requests and limits defined. Example Deployment YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "250m"
            memory: "256Mi"
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "512Mi"
```
- **Requests**: Minimum resources guaranteed (250m CPU, 256Mi memory).
- **Limits**: Maximum resources allowed (500m CPU, 512Mi memory).
- HPA uses these values to calculate utilization (e.g., 50% of 500m CPU = 250m CPU).

---

### 5. Advanced Metrics for HPA
While CPU and memory are the default metrics for HPA, Kubernetes supports **custom metrics** and **external metrics** for advanced use cases.

#### Custom Metrics
- **Definition**: Application-specific metrics provided by a custom metrics adapter (e.g., Prometheus).
- **Examples**:
  - HTTP requests per second.
  - Queue length in a message broker.
- **Requirements**:
  - Install a custom metrics adapter (e.g., Prometheus Adapter).
  - Configure the HPA to use the custom metric.
- **Example YAML**:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
  kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
  metadata:
    name: my-app-hpa
  spec:
    scaleTargetRef:
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      name: my-app
    minReplicas: 1
    maxReplicas: 10
    metrics:
    - type: Pods
      pods:
        metric:
          name: http_requests_per_second
        target:
          type: AverageValue
          averageValue: 100
  ```
  - Scales the Deployment to maintain an average of 100 HTTP requests per second per Pod.

#### External Metrics
- **Definition**: Metrics from systems outside the Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Datadog, Dynatrace).
- **Examples**:
  - Number of messages in an AWS SQS queue.
  - External database query rate.
- **Requirements**:
  - An external metrics adapter to integrate with the external system.
  - Configuration of the HPA to reference the external metric.
- **Example YAML**:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
  kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
  metadata:
    name: my-app-hpa
  spec:
    scaleTargetRef:
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      name: my-app
    minReplicas: 1
    maxReplicas: 10
    metrics:
    - type: External
      external:
        metric:
          name: sqs_queue_length
        target:
          type: Value
          value: 500
  ```
  - Scales the Deployment to maintain an SQS queue length of 500 messages.
- **Note**: Custom and external metrics are advanced topics and typically beyond the CKA exam scope but may be referenced in the Kubernetes autoscaling course mentioned in the transcript.

---

### 6. Key Considerations for HPA
- **Metrics Server Dependency**:
  - HPA requires the Metrics Server to provide CPU/memory utilization data.
  - Ensure it’s running:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metrics-server
    ```
  - If not installed, HPA will fail to scale based on resource metrics.
- **Resource Requests and Limits**:
  - Pods must have CPU/memory requests and limits defined in their spec for HPA to calculate utilization accurately.
  - Without limits, HPA may behave unpredictably, as it cannot determine the target utilization percentage.
- **Stabilization Window**:
  - HPA includes a stabilization period (default: 5 minutes for scale-down) to prevent rapid fluctuations in replica counts.
  - Configurable via the `behavior` field in the HPA spec (introduced in Kubernetes 1.18).
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    spec:
      behavior:
        scaleDown:
          stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300
    ```
- **Minimum and Maximum Replicas**:
  - `minReplicas` ensures a minimum number of Pods for reliability.
  - `maxReplicas` prevents uncontrolled scaling that could overwhelm the cluster.
- **Conflicts with VPA**:
  - Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) adjusts resource requests/limits, which can conflict with HPA’s replica-based scaling.
  - Avoid using HPA and VPA on the same workload unless carefully configured.
- **Cluster Capacity**:
  - HPA assumes sufficient cluster resources (nodes) to schedule additional Pods.
  - If the cluster lacks capacity, the Cluster Autoscaler (if enabled) can add nodes.

### 7. Practical Examples for CKA Exam Preparation
Below are practical examples to reinforce HPA concepts and prepare for the CKA exam.

#### Example 1: Create an HPA (Imperative)
Create an HPA for a Deployment named `web-app` to scale between 2 and 8 Pods based on 70% CPU utilization:
```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment web-app --min=2 --max=8 --cpu-percent=70
```
Verify:
```bash
kubectl get hpa
```
Output:
```
NAME         REFERENCE             TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
web-app-hpa  Deployment/web-app    20%/70%   2         8         2          10m
```

#### Example 2: Create an HPA (Declarative)
Create a YAML file (`hpa-web-app.yaml`):
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: web-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: web-app
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 8
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```
Apply:
```bash
kubectl apply -f hpa-web-app.yaml
```
Verify:
```bash
kubectl describe hpa web-app-hpa
```

#### Example 3: Monitor Resource Usage
Check Pod CPU usage to understand why HPA is scaling:
```bash
kubectl top pods
```
Output:
```
NAME                       CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)
web-app-5f7b4c9d5-abcde   200m         100Mi
web-app-5f7b4c9d5-fghij   250m         120Mi
```
Ensure Metrics Server is running:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metrics-server
```

#### Example 4: Delete an HPA
Remove an HPA when no longer needed:
```bash
kubectl delete hpa web-app-hpa
```

#### Example 5: Simulate a Load to Test HPA
Use a load generator (e.g., `stress` container) to increase CPU usage and observe HPA scaling:
```bash
kubectl run load-generator --image=busybox -- /bin/sh -c "while true; do wget -q -O- http://web-app; done"
```
Monitor HPA:
```bash
kubectl get hpa -w
```
- The `-w` flag watches for changes in real-time.
- Expect the number of replicas to increase if CPU usage exceeds 70%.

---

### 8. Troubleshooting HPA
- **HPA Not Scaling**:
  - **Check Metrics Server**:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metrics-server
    ```
    Ensure it’s running and accessible.
  - **Verify Resource Limits**:
    Check the Deployment’s Pod spec for CPU/memory requests and limits.
    ```bash
    kubectl get deployment web-app -o yaml
    ```
  - **Inspect HPA Events**:
    ```bash
    kubectl describe hpa web-app-hpa
    ```
    Look for errors like “failed to get CPU utilization” or “missing metrics.”
- **HPA Scaling Incorrectly**:
  - Ensure `minReplicas` and `maxReplicas` are set appropriately.
  - Check the target utilization threshold (e.g., 70% may be too high or low for the workload).
- **Cluster Resource Constraints**:
  - If Pods are unschedulable, check node capacity:
    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    kubectl describe nodes
    ```
  - Consider enabling the Cluster Autoscaler if running in a cloud environment.
