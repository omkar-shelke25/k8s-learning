Let’s dive into GitLab CI/CD, focusing on the **image** and **service** options when creating pipelines. We’ll explore how these features work with runners, particularly GitLab-hosted runners, and break down each concept with detailed explanations and examples.

---

### Understanding GitLab CI/CD Pipelines and Runners

In GitLab CI/CD, a **pipeline** is a collection of jobs that automate your workflow—think building, testing, or deploying code. Each job in the pipeline runs on a **runner**, a machine or environment that executes the job’s steps. When setting up a pipeline, you define this configuration in a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

GitLab provides **GitLab-hosted runners** (also called SaaS runners), which are preconfigured environments managed by GitLab. These runners save you the hassle of setting up your own infrastructure. For example, a GitLab-hosted Linux-based runner might come with:
- Language runtimes (e.g., Ruby, Node.js)
- Package management tools (e.g., `npm`, `pip`)
- Command-line utilities (e.g., `git`, `curl`)
- Cached Docker images
- Web browsers (e.g., for testing)

By default, a GitLab-hosted Linux runner uses a **Ruby 3.1 container**. This is fantastic for Ruby projects because it provides a ready-to-use environment, reducing setup time and letting developers focus on coding. However, if your project isn’t Ruby-based—say, a Node.js or Python app—running it in a Ruby container might lead to confusion or errors due to Ruby-specific tools.

---

### The Challenge: Customizing the Environment

What if your job needs a specific runtime or package not included in the default Ruby container? For instance, suppose you’re running unit tests for a Node.js app that requires **Node.js 20**, which isn’t pre-installed. You could add installation steps in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
unit-test-job:
  script:
    - apt-get update
    - apt-get install -y nodejs=20.*
    - npm install
    - npm test
```

Here, the job runs in the default Ruby container, and the `script` section installs Node.js 20 before executing the tests. But there’s a downside: installing runtimes or packages during the job takes time, which can:
- Slow down your pipeline.
- Increase GitLab CI/CD billing costs (since usage is often time-based).

To solve this, GitLab CI/CD offers **image containers** and **service containers**, which let you define precise, efficient environments for your jobs.

---

### Concept 1: Image Containers

#### What Are Image Containers?

An **image container** is a Docker image that defines the environment your job runs in. Think of it as a prebuilt sandbox tailored to your job’s needs. Each job gets its own isolated container, ensuring:
- **Isolation**: Dependencies don’t conflict between jobs.
- **Reproducibility**: The job runs consistently, no matter the runner.
- **Efficiency**: You avoid manual installations by using an image with the tools you need.

#### How to Use Image Containers

You specify an image container using the `image` keyword in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`. For example, if your job needs Node.js 20:

```yaml
unit-test-job:
  image: node:20
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm test
```

- **`image: node:20`**: Tells GitLab to use the official Node.js 20 Docker image from Docker Hub.
- **Execution**: GitLab provisions a hosted Linux runner, spins up a container based on `node:20`, and runs the `script` commands inside it.

Since Node.js 20 is already in the image, there’s no need to install it manually—saving time and costs.

#### Example: Node.js Application

Let’s say you’re testing a Node.js backend service. Without an image container, you’d install Node.js in the default Ruby container, which is inefficient. With an image container:

```yaml
backend-test-job:
  image: node:20
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run test
```

The `node:20` image provides Node.js 20 and `npm` out of the box. The job runs isolated from other jobs, and the environment is reproducible across runs.

#### Advanced Configuration

You can fine-tune image containers with options like:
- **Pull Policy**: `pull_policy: always` ensures the latest image is fetched.
- **Entry Point**: Override the default entry point if needed (e.g., `entrypoint: ["/bin/bash"]`).

---

### Concept 2: Service Containers

#### What Are Service Containers?

A **service container** is an additional Docker container that runs alongside your job’s image container, providing resources or services your job needs—like a database, cache, or mock server. They’re like specialized tools that support your main task without cluttering the job environment.

#### Why Use Service Containers?

Imagine your Node.js unit tests need a database. Connecting to a **production database** during testing is a bad idea—it could slow down or corrupt production data. Instead, use a service container to spin up a temporary database for testing.

Service containers offer:
- **Isolation**: They run separately from the job container.
- **Flexibility**: Use prebuilt images (e.g., `mysql:latest`) or custom ones.
- **Temporary Resources**: They exist only for the job’s duration.

#### How to Use Service Containers

You define service containers with the `services` keyword. For example, a job testing a Node.js app with MongoDB:

```yaml
unit-test-job:
  image: node:20
  services:
    - name: mongo:latest
      alias: mongo
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm test
```

- **`image: node:20`**: The job runs in a Node.js 20 container.
- **`services`**: Spins up a `mongo:latest` container, aliased as `mongo`.
- **Execution**: GitLab runs two containers:
  1. The **job container** (`node:20`) installs dependencies and runs tests.
  2. The **service container** (`mongo:latest`) provides a MongoDB instance.

#### How Do They Communicate?

The job and service containers run in the same **user-defined bridge network**, so all ports are exposed between them. For MongoDB:
- **Hostname**: Matches the alias (`mongo` in this case).
- **Port**: Default MongoDB port is `27017`.

Your Node.js tests can connect to `mongo:27017` without extra configuration.

#### Example: Node.js with MongoDB

Suppose your app has a test suite that inserts test data into MongoDB and verifies the output. Here’s the `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
unit-test-job:
  image: node:20
  services:
    - name: mongo:latest
      alias: mongo
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm test
```

- The `mongo` service starts a fresh MongoDB instance.
- The Node.js app connects to `mongo:27017`, runs tests, and the service shuts down when the job ends.
- No production database is touched, and no manual MongoDB setup is needed.

#### Advanced Use Cases

- **Custom Services**: Build a custom Docker image with preloaded test data.
- **Multiple Services**: Add more services, like Redis or MySQL, if your job needs them:

```yaml
complex-test-job:
  image: node:20
  services:
    - name: mongo:latest
      alias: mongo
    - name: redis:latest
      alias: redis
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm test
```

---

### Putting It All Together

Let’s implement a pipeline for a Node.js app with unit tests requiring MongoDB:

```yaml
unit-test-job:
  image: node:20
  services:
    - name: mongo:latest
      alias: mongo
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm test
```

**How It Works:**
1. GitLab selects a hosted Linux runner.
2. The runner creates:
   - A `node:20` container for the job.
   - A `mongo:latest` container as a service.
3. The job container runs `npm install` and `npm test`, connecting to `mongo:27017`.
4. Both containers are discarded after the job finishes.

**Benefits:**
- No manual Node.js or MongoDB installation.
- Isolated testing environment.
- Faster execution and lower costs.

---

### Key Takeaways

1. **Image Containers**:
   - Define the job’s environment (e.g., `node:20`).
   - Provide isolation and reproducibility.
   - Eliminate runtime installation overhead.

2. **Service Containers**:
   - Add resources like databases (e.g., `mongo:latest`).
   - Run alongside the job container, accessible via a network.
   - Keep production systems safe and testing efficient.

By leveraging image and service containers, you can craft GitLab CI/CD pipelines that are fast, cost-effective, and tailored to your project’s needs—whether it’s Ruby, Node.js, Python, or beyond.



Here’s a proper example of using Spring Boot in a real-world scenario, integrated with a GitLab CI/CD pipeline for testing. This example demonstrates how to set up a Spring Boot application that connects to a PostgreSQL database and how to test it in an automated pipeline using Docker containers.

---

## Scenario: A Spring Boot Application with PostgreSQL

Let’s assume we’re building a Spring Boot application that interacts with a PostgreSQL database. We’ll write a simple test to verify the database connection and configure a GitLab CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing process. This setup ensures the application works consistently in development and CI/CD environments.

---

## Step 1: Spring Boot Application Setup

First, let’s create a basic Spring Boot application.

### Dependencies

In your `pom.xml`, include the necessary dependencies for Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and testing:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- Spring Boot Starter for Web -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Spring Boot Starter for JDBC -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jdbc</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <!-- PostgreSQL Driver -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
        <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
        <version>42.6.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Spring Boot Starter for Testing -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <!-- AssertJ for Assertions -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.assertj</groupId>
        <artifactId>assertj-core</artifactId>
        <version>3.24.2</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Application Configuration

Configure the database connection in `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/testdb
    username: testuser
    password: testpassword
```

For testing, we’ll override these properties in the CI/CD pipeline to connect to a temporary PostgreSQL instance.

### Sample Test

Create a test to verify the database connection in `src/test/java/com/example/demo/MyTest.java`:

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

@SpringBootTest
public class MyTest {

    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    @Test
    public void testDatabaseConnection() {
        Integer result = jdbcTemplate.queryForObject("SELECT 1", Integer.class);
        assertThat(result).isEqualTo(1);
    }
}
```

This test uses `JdbcTemplate` to execute a simple query (`SELECT 1`) and checks if the result is `1`, confirming the database connection works.

---

## Step 2: GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Setup

To test this Spring Boot application in a CI/CD pipeline, we’ll use GitLab’s `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. The pipeline will:
- Use a Maven container to build and run tests.
- Spin up a PostgreSQL container as a service for the tests.

### Pipeline Configuration (`.gitlab-ci.yml`)

```yaml
stages:
  - test

spring-boot-test:
  stage: test
  image: maven:3.8.5-openjdk-17
  services:
    - name: postgres:14
      alias: postgres
  variables:
    POSTGRES_DB: testdb
    POSTGRES_USER: testuser
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: testpassword
    SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/testdb
    SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: testuser
    SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: testpassword
  script:
    - mvn clean test
```

### Explanation

- **Stages**: Defines a `test` stage for the pipeline.
- **Job (`spring-boot-test`)**:
  - **Image**: `maven:3.8.5-openjdk-17` — Runs the job in a container with Java 17 and Maven, suitable for Spring Boot 3.x.
  - **Services**: `postgres:14` — Starts a PostgreSQL 14 container, aliased as `postgres`.
  - **Variables**:
    - `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Configures the PostgreSQL service.
    - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_*`: Overrides the Spring Boot datasource properties to connect to the `postgres` service container.
  - **Script**: `mvn clean test` — Cleans the project and runs all tests.

---

## How It Works

1. **Pipeline Execution**:
   - GitLab starts a runner.
   - The runner creates two containers:
     - A `maven:3.8.5-openjdk-17` container for the job.
     - A `postgres:14` container as the service.

2. **PostgreSQL Setup**:
   - The `postgres` container initializes a database named `testdb` with the user `testuser` and password `testpassword`.

3. **Test Execution**:
   - The Maven container runs `mvn clean test`.
   - The Spring Boot test connects to `jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/testdb` (where `postgres` is the service container’s hostname).
   - The test executes the `SELECT 1` query and verifies the result.

4. **Cleanup**:
   - After the job finishes, both containers are discarded, leaving no persistent changes.

---

## Benefits of This Setup

- **Isolation**: Tests run in a clean environment, separate from production.
- **Automation**: No manual setup of Java, Maven, or PostgreSQL is required.
- **Consistency**: The same environment is used every time, reducing errors.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable to include build, deployment, or other stages.

## Running Locally (Optional)

To test this locally before pushing to GitLab:
1. Install Docker.
2. Start a PostgreSQL container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=testdb -e POSTGRES_USER=testuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=testpassword -p 5432:5432 postgres:14
   ```
3. Run the tests with Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean test
   ```

---

## Conclusion

This example shows how to use Spring Boot to build a simple application with a PostgreSQL database and integrate it into a GitLab CI/CD pipeline. By leveraging Docker containers for both the application runtime (Maven) and the database (PostgreSQL), you get a robust, automated, and reproducible testing process. This setup is a practical starting point for any Spring Boot project requiring database interaction.
