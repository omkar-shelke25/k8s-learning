### 1. **Run Jobs with Shared Runners**

**Explanation**:  
Shared runners are pre-configured GitLab runners available to all projects in a GitLab instance. They are managed by GitLab (or the instance admin) and allow you to execute CI/CD jobs without setting up your own runner infrastructure. This is ideal for small teams, open-source projects, or anyone who wants to leverage GitLab’s resources instead of maintaining their own servers.

**Production Example**:  
Imagine you’re maintaining a small Node.js API for a startup. You want to automate building and testing the code without investing in dedicated CI/CD servers. Here’s how you can use shared runners:

```yaml
stages:
  - build

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Installing dependencies and building the project"
    - npm install
    - npm run build
```

**How It Works**:  
- Since no specific runner tags are defined, GitLab assigns an available shared runner (e.g., a Docker-based runner) to execute this job.
- The runner pulls your repository, runs the commands (`npm install` and `npm run build`), and reports the result back to GitLab.
- In production, this might compile your Node.js app into a distributable bundle.

**Key Points**:  
- **Scalability**: Shared runners handle the workload for you, scaling automatically.
- **Cost-Effective**: No need to manage your own servers.
- **Limitations**: Shared runners might have resource constraints or queue times during peak usage.

### 2. **Install Third-Party Libraries Using `before_script`**

**Explanation**:  
The `before_script` keyword lets you run setup commands before the main `script` section of a job. It’s commonly used to install dependencies, configure environments, or fetch third-party libraries required for the job to succeed.

**Production Example**:  
Suppose you’re running a Python Flask application in production, and your tests require the `requests` library. You can install it using `before_script`:

```yaml
stages:
  - test

test_job:
  stage: test
  before_script:
    - pip install requests==2.28.1
  script:
    - echo "Running tests with requests library"
    - python -c "import requests; print(requests.__version__)"
    - pytest tests/
```

**How It Works**:  
- **Before Script**: `pip install requests==2.28.1` installs the specified version of the `requests` library.
- **Main Script**: The job verifies the installation and runs tests that rely on `requests` (e.g., API integration tests).
- In a production pipeline, this ensures your test environment matches your app’s requirements.

**Key Points**:  
- **Consistency**: Guarantees dependencies are installed before execution.
- **Separation**: Keeps setup logic separate from the main task, improving readability.
- **Reusability**: You can define `before_script` globally to apply to all jobs if needed.

### 3. **Executing Shell Scripts in a Job**

**Explanation**:  
GitLab CI/CD jobs can execute shell commands or entire shell scripts directly in the `script` section. This is useful for running build tools, deployment scripts, or custom automation tasks written as shell scripts.

**Production Example**:  
Imagine you’re deploying a static website to an S3 bucket in production. You have a script `deploy_to_s3.sh` that syncs files to S3:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy_to_s3.sh
echo "Deploying to S3 bucket"
aws s3 sync ./dist/ s3://my-production-bucket --region us-east-1
echo "Deployment complete"
```

Here’s the GitLab job:

```yaml
stages:
  - deploy

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - chmod +x deploy_to_s3.sh
    - ./deploy_to_s3.sh
```

**How It Works**:  
- The job makes the script executable (`chmod +x`) and runs it.
- The script uses the AWS CLI to upload the `dist/` directory (e.g., a built React app) to an S3 bucket.
- In production, this automates deployment to a live environment.

**Key Points**:  
- **Flexibility**: Reuse existing scripts or write new ones for complex tasks.
- **Debugging**: Output is logged in GitLab, making it easy to troubleshoot.
- **Security**: Ensure scripts are trusted, as they run with the runner’s permissions.

### 4. **Pipeline with Multiple Dependent Jobs**

**Explanation**:  
A GitLab pipeline can include multiple jobs organized into stages, where each stage depends on the previous one completing successfully. This ensures a logical workflow, like building code before testing it and deploying only if tests pass.

**Production Example**:  
For a Java Spring Boot application, you might have a pipeline with build, test, and deploy stages:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the Spring Boot app"
    - mvn clean package

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests"
    - mvn test

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to production"
    - scp target/myapp.jar prod-server:/apps/
```

**How It Works**:  
- **Build**: Compiles the app into a JAR file (`myapp.jar`).
- **Test**: Runs unit tests, but only if the build succeeds.
- **Deploy**: Copies the JAR to a production server, but only if tests pass.
- In production, this ensures only validated code reaches the live environment.

**Key Points**:  
- **Order**: Stages enforce dependency (build → test → deploy).
- **Reliability**: Prevents deployment of broken code.
- **Scalability**: Add more stages (e.g., linting, security scans) as needed.

### 5. **Using `stage` vs `stages` Keyword**

**Explanation**:  
- **`stages`**: A top-level keyword that defines the order of stages in the pipeline (e.g., build, test, deploy).
- **`stage`**: A job-level keyword that assigns a job to a specific stage, determining when it runs.

**Production Example**:  
For a Ruby on Rails app, define stages and assign jobs:

```yaml
stages:
  - lint
  - test
  - deploy

lint_job:
  stage: lint
  script:
    - rubocop

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - bundle install
    - rspec

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - cap production deploy
```

**How It Works**:  
- **`stages`**: Sets the sequence: lint → test → deploy.
- **`stage`**: Places each job in its respective stage:
  - `lint_job` runs first, checking code quality.
  - `test_job` runs next, executing tests.
  - `deploy_job` runs last, deploying to production (e.g., via Capistrano).
- In production, this ensures code is linted and tested before deployment.

**Key Points**:  
- **Structure**: `stages` provides the pipeline’s blueprint.
- **Assignment**: `stage` links jobs to that blueprint.
- **Clarity**: Makes pipeline flow easy to understand.

### 6. **Artifacts - Storing Job Data**

**Explanation**:  
Artifacts are files or directories produced by a job that can be stored or passed to later jobs. They’re perfect for sharing build outputs, test reports, or deployment assets across the pipeline.

**Production Example**:  
For a frontend app built with Webpack, you can save the compiled assets:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - aws s3 sync dist/ s3://my-frontend-bucket
```

**How It Works**:  
- **Build**: Compiles the app, generating files in `dist/`. The `artifacts` keyword saves `dist/`.
- **Deploy**: Uses the `dist/` folder from the build job to upload to S3.
- In production, this ensures the deploy job uses the exact output from the build.

**Key Points**:  
- **Efficiency**: Avoids rebuilding assets in later jobs.
- **Persistence**: Artifacts can be downloaded later or stored (with expiration settings).
- **Use Case**: Common for binaries, reports, or static files.

### 7. **Using `needs` Keyword**

**Explanation**:  
The `needs` keyword lets a job start as soon as its specified dependencies complete, bypassing the default stage order. This optimizes pipeline speed by allowing parallel execution when possible.

**Production Example**:  
For a microservices app, you might build a service and deploy it without waiting for unrelated tests:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t my-service:latest .
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - Dockerfile

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - docker run my-service:latest pytest

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  needs: ["build_job"]
  script:
    - docker push my-service:latest
```

**How It Works**:  
- **Build**: Creates a Docker image.
- **Test**: Runs tests on the image (depends on build by stage order).
- **Deploy**: Pushes the image to a registry as soon as `build_job` finishes, not waiting for `test_job`.
- In production, this speeds up deployment if testing is a separate concern.

**Key Points**:  
- **Speed**: Reduces pipeline runtime by running jobs concurrently.
- **Flexibility**: Overrides stage-based dependencies for specific needs.
- **Caution**: Ensure critical dependencies (e.g., tests) are still met if required.
