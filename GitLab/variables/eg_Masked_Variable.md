### Example: GitLab CI/CD Pipeline with a Masked Variable

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

# Note: Sensitive values (like DOCKER_PASSWORD) are defined in CI/CD settings,
# not in this file. They are stored as masked variables.
variables:
  IMAGE_NAME: my-app  # Global variable for demonstration purposes

stages:
  - build
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Starting build stage..."
    - docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME .
    # Using the masked variable from CI/CD settings to authenticate with Docker.
    - docker login -u myusername -p $DOCKER_PASSWORD
    - docker push $IMAGE_NAME
  only:
    - main

# Hidden job example:
# By prefixing the job name with a dot, this job becomes hidden.
.deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying $IMAGE_NAME to production..."
    # This deployment script uses the sensitive DOCKER_PASSWORD variable.
    - ./deploy_script.sh $DOCKER_PASSWORD
  when: manual  # This job will only run when manually triggered.
  only:
    - main
```

### Detailed Explanation and Deep Notes

#### 1. Sensitive Variables and Masking

- **Storing Sensitive Data:**  
  Sensitive values such as `DOCKER_PASSWORD` should **not** be hardcoded in your repository. Instead, they are set in the CI/CD settings panel (accessible from your project or group settings).  
  - **Masking:** When you mark a variable as masked, its value is replaced with asterisks (or similar) in the job logs. This means even if the variable is printed or logged, the actual password remains hidden.
  - **Protected Variables:** You also have the option to mark variables as protected so that they are only available on protected branches. This further secures deployment processes.

- **How to Configure in CI/CD Settings:**  
  1. Navigate to your repositoryâ€™s settings and select **CI/CD**.
  2. Open the **Variables** section.
  3. Create a new variable with:
     - **Key:** e.g., `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
     - **Value:** e.g., `your_secure_password`
     - Enable the **Mask** flag (and optionally **Protected** if needed).
  4. Save the variable. Now it can be referenced securely in your pipeline.

#### 2. Pipeline Stages and Job Definitions

- **Stages:**  
  The pipeline is divided into multiple stages (`build` and `deploy`). This allows you to separate concerns, such as building the Docker image first and deploying it afterward.

- **Build Job:**  
  - **Purpose:** The `build` job builds your Docker image and pushes it to a registry.
  - **Usage of Masked Variable:**  
    The command `docker login -u myusername -p $DOCKER_PASSWORD` uses the masked variable. Even though this command runs in your script, the actual password is not exposed in the pipeline logs.
  - **Branch Restriction:**  
    The `only: - main` setting restricts the job to run only on the `main` branch, a common practice to prevent unintended builds on feature branches.

- **Hidden Job Example (Deploy):**  
  - **Hidden Jobs:**  
    Prefixing a job name with a dot (e.g., `.deploy`) makes it a hidden job. Hidden jobs appear in the pipeline editor but do not execute by default.  
    This is useful if you want to keep certain jobs available for manual triggering or for debugging without affecting the main pipeline.
  - **Manual Trigger:**  
    The `when: manual` option indicates that this job requires manual intervention to run. This is often used for production deployments.
  - **Dependency on Sensitive Variable:**  
    The deployment script (`./deploy_script.sh $DOCKER_PASSWORD`) again uses the masked `DOCKER_PASSWORD`, ensuring that even if the deployment process requires sensitive information, it is protected.

#### 3. Best Practices and Additional Considerations

- **Security:**  
  Always use CI/CD variables to handle sensitive information. Masking ensures that passwords and tokens remain confidential, even if the pipeline logs are publicly visible or shared among team members.

- **Access Control:**  
  Keep in mind that users with access to the CI/CD settings can view and modify these variables. Ensure that only trusted team members have the necessary permissions.

- **Environment-Specific Variables:**  
  You can associate variables with specific environments (like staging or production) to ensure that the correct credentials and configurations are used in the appropriate context.

- **Job Dependencies and Debugging:**  
  When hiding jobs (such as by prefixing with a dot), remember that any other job that depends on outputs from a hidden job may fail. Always check and update job dependencies when making changes.

- **Documentation and Maintenance:**  
  Document your CI/CD pipeline configuration and variable usage. Keeping a clear record helps in maintaining the pipeline, troubleshooting issues, and onboarding new team members.
