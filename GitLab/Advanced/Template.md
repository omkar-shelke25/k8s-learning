### 1. Understanding GitLab CI/CD Templates in Depth

GitLab CI/CD pipelines are defined in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file at the root of your repository. This file specifies **stages** (e.g., `test`, `build`, `deploy`) and **jobs** (tasks like running tests or deploying code). Without templates, you’d write this YAML manually for every project, which is inefficient and prone to mistakes. Templates are pre-written YAML snippets that you can include to streamline this process.

#### Why Use Templates?
- **Speed**: Reuse existing configurations instead of starting from zero.
- **Standardization**: Ensure teams follow best practices.
- **Flexibility**: Modify templates to fit unique project needs.

Templates come in two forms:
- **Pipeline Templates**: Define an entire workflow (multiple stages and jobs).
- **Job Templates**: Define standalone jobs you can plug into your pipeline.

### 2. Pipeline Templates: A Full Workflow

A pipeline template provides a complete CI/CD setup for a specific project type. Let’s explore a detailed Node.js pipeline template as an example and see how teams can use and adapt it.

#### Example: Node.js Pipeline Template (`nodejs-pipeline.yml`)
```yaml
# Define the stages of the pipeline
stages:
  - test
  - build
  - deploy

# Variables reusable across jobs
variables:
  DOCKER_REGISTRY: "docker.io"
  IMAGE_NAME: "my-app"

# Job to run unit tests
unit_tests:
  stage: test
  image: node:18-alpine
  script:
    - npm ci                # Faster than npm install, uses package-lock.json
    - npm test              # Runs tests (e.g., Jest or Mocha)
  artifacts:
    reports:
      junit: test-results.xml  # Stores test results for GitLab UI
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/       # Cache dependencies for faster runs

# Job to check code coverage
code_coverage:
  stage: test
  image: node:18-alpine
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run coverage      # Assumes a coverage script in package.json
  coverage: '/Coverage: \d+\.\d+%/'  # Extracts coverage % for GitLab UI
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - coverage/           # Stores coverage report

# Job to build and push a Docker image
build_docker:
  stage: build
  image: docker:20
  services:
    - docker:dind          # Docker-in-Docker for building images
  script:
    - docker build -t $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$IMAGE_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_SHA .
    - docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME -p $DOCKER_PASSWORD $DOCKER_REGISTRY
    - docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$IMAGE_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  dependencies:
    - unit_tests          # Ensures tests pass before building

# Job to deploy to AWS EKS
deploy_eks:
  stage: deploy
  image: bitnami/kubectl:1.23
  script:
    - aws eks update-kubeconfig --region $AWS_REGION --name my-eks-cluster
    - kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
  environment:
    name: production
    url: https://my-app.example.com
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"'  # Only run on main branch
```

**What’s Happening Here?**
- **Stages**: `test`, `build`, `deploy` define the workflow order.
- **unit_tests**: Installs dependencies, runs tests, caches `node_modules`, and stores test results.
- **code_coverage**: Runs a coverage report and extracts the percentage for GitLab’s UI.
- **build_docker**: Builds a Docker image, logs into Docker Hub, and pushes the image.
- **deploy_eks**: Configures AWS EKS access and deploys the app using Kubernetes manifests.

#### Team A: Using the Template with Minimal Changes
Team A works on a Node.js app and wants to use this template as-is, adding only their credentials.

**Their `.gitlab-ci.yml`:**
```yaml
include:
  - local: 'nodejs-pipeline.yml'

# Define secrets via GitLab CI/CD variables (Settings > CI/CD > Variables)
variables:
  DOCKER_USERNAME: "teama_docker"
  DOCKER_PASSWORD: "$DOCKER_PASS"      # Stored as a masked variable
  AWS_REGION: "us-east-1"
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "$AWS_KEY"        # Stored as a protected variable
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "$AWS_SECRET" # Stored as a protected variable
```

**How It Works for Team A:**
- They include the template using `include: local`.
- They set variables for Docker Hub and AWS credentials (stored securely in GitLab).
- The pipeline runs unchanged: tests run, the Docker image is built and pushed to Docker Hub, and the app deploys to their EKS cluster.
- **Time Saved**: No need to write 50+ lines of YAML; they just configure credentials.

#### Team B: Customizing the Template
Team B also uses Node.js but deploys to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and pushes images to Google Container Registry (GCR).

**Their `.gitlab-ci.yml`:**
```yaml
include:
  - local: 'nodejs-pipeline.yml'

# Override variables
variables:
  DOCKER_REGISTRY: "gcr.io"
  IMAGE_NAME: "my-gcp-project/my-app"

# Keep unit_tests and code_coverage, override build_docker
build_docker:
  script:
    - docker build -t $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$IMAGE_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_SHA .
    - gcloud auth configure-docker --quiet
    - docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$IMAGE_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_SHA

# Replace deploy_eks with deploy_gke
deploy_gke:
  stage: deploy
  image: google/cloud-sdk:slim
  script:
    - gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-gke-cluster --zone us-central1
    - kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
  environment:
    name: staging
    url: https://staging.my-app.example.com
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "staging"'

# Disable the original deploy_eks
deploy_eks:
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "never-run-this"'  # Effectively disables it
```

**How It Works for Team B:**
- They reuse `unit_tests` and `code_coverage` unchanged.
- They override `build_docker` to use GCR and authenticate with `gcloud`.
- They replace `deploy_eks` with `deploy_gke`, targeting GKE and running only on the `staging` branch.
- **Flexibility**: The template’s core is reused, but deployment is tailored to their infrastructure.

### 3. Job Templates: Modular Building Blocks

Job templates define individual tasks you can include in a pipeline. Let’s create a reusable job template for linting code.

#### Example: Linting Job Template (`lint-template.yml`)
```yaml
lint_code:
  stage: test
  image: node:18-alpine
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run lint  # Assumes an ESLint script in package.json
  artifacts:
    reports:
      codequality: eslint-report.json  # For GitLab Code Quality integration
```

#### Using It in a Pipeline
**`.gitlab-ci.yml`:**
```yaml
include:
  - local: 'lint-template.yml'

stages:
  - test
  - deploy

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to production"
```

**What Happens?**
- The `lint_code` job runs during the `test` stage.
- You’ve built a minimal pipeline by combining a reusable job with a custom `deploy` job.
- **Modularity**: Add more job templates (e.g., `unit_tests`) as needed.

---

### 4. Including Templates: Deep Dive with Examples

The `include` keyword lets you import templates from various sources. Let’s explore each method.

#### 4.1 `include: local`
For templates in the same repository.

**Example: `.gitlab-ci.yml`**
```yaml
include:
  - local: 'lint-template.yml'

lint_code:
  variables:
    ESLINT_CONFIG: ".eslintrc-custom.json"  # Customize the job
```

- Imports `lint-template.yml` from the same repo and branch.
- Adds a variable to tweak the linting config.

#### 4.2 `include: project`
For templates in another project on the same GitLab instance.

**Example: `.gitlab-ci.yml`**
```yaml
include:
  - project: 'devops/ci-templates'
    file: 'nodejs-pipeline.yml'
    ref: 'v1.2.0'  # Pins to a specific tag

unit_tests:
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm test -- --verbose  # Override for more detailed output
```

- Pulls `nodejs-pipeline.yml` from the `devops/ci-templates` project, tag `v1.2.0`.
- Customizes `unit_tests` with a more verbose test run.

#### 4.3 `include: remote`
For templates hosted externally.

**Example: `.gitlab-ci.yml`**
```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://gitlab.com/my-org/templates/-/raw/main/security-scan.yml'

my_job:
  script:
    - echo "Custom job"
```

**Hypothetical `security-scan.yml`:**
```yaml
security_scan:
  stage: test
  image: alpine
  script:
    - apk add trivy
    - trivy fs .
```

- Imports a security scanning template from a public GitLab URL.
- Adds a custom job alongside it.
- **Security Note**: Verify the source, as this code runs in your pipeline.

#### 4.4 `include: template`
For GitLab’s built-in templates.

**Example: `.gitlab-ci.yml`**
```yaml
include:
  - template: 'SAST.gitlab-ci.yml'  # Static Application Security Testing

stages:
  - test
  - sast

my_tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests"
```

- Imports GitLab’s SAST template for security scanning.
- Adds a custom `my_tests` job.

#### 4.5 Conditional Includes with `rules`
Limit when a template is included.

**Example: `.gitlab-ci.yml`**
```yaml
include:
  - template: 'Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yml'
    rules:
      - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH =~ /^feature/ || $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"'

unit_tests:
  script:
    - npm test
```

- Includes the `Code-Quality` template only for feature branches or merge requests.
- Adds a custom `unit_tests` job.

---

### 5. Practical Customization Examples

#### Example 1: Adding a New Stage
Add a `review` stage to the Node.js pipeline.

**`.gitlab-ci.yml`:**
```yaml
include:
  - local: 'nodejs-pipeline.yml'

stages:
  - test
  - build
  - review
  - deploy

deploy_review:
  stage: review
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to review environment"
  environment:
    name: review/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
```

- Extends the template’s stages with `review`.
- Adds a `deploy_review` job for temporary review apps.

#### Example 2: Overriding a Job
Change how `build_docker` tags images.

**`.gitlab-ci.yml`:**
```yaml
include:
  - local: 'nodejs-pipeline.yml'

build_docker:
  script:
    - docker build -t $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$IMAGE_NAME:latest .
    - docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$IMAGE_NAME:latest
```

- Overrides `build_docker` to use a `latest` tag instead of `$CI_COMMIT_SHA`.

---

### 6. Key Takeaways with Real-World Context

1. **Efficiency**: Team A saved hours by reusing `nodejs-pipeline.yml` instead of writing it.
2. **Adaptability**: Team B swapped EKS for GKE, showing templates aren’t rigid.
3. **Modularity**: Use `lint-template.yml` alone or with other jobs as needed.

---

### 7. Best Practices
- **Secure Secrets**: Store credentials in GitLab CI/CD variables, not in YAML.
- **Version Control**: Use `ref` to pin templates to specific versions.
- **Validate**: Test pipelines with `gitlab-runner exec` locally or GitLab’s pipeline editor.

---

### Conclusion
GitLab CI/CD templates are a game-changer for DevOps workflows. Pipeline templates give you a full workflow to start with, while job templates let you build piece-by-piece. With `include`, you can pull from local files, other projects, remote URLs, or GitLab’s library, and `rules` add fine-grained control. Whether you’re Team A deploying to EKS or Team B targeting GKE, templates adapt to your needs while keeping things DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).
