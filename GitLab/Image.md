# Deep Notes on Running Jobs Within a Specific Docker Image in GitLab CI

In this guide, we’ll explore how to run jobs within a specific Docker image in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, focusing on deploying a Node.js-based application. We'll cover why the default Docker image might not work, how to handle dependency issues, and how to optimize your pipeline by using a pre-built Docker image. Examples will be provided to illustrate each concept clearly.

## Introduction
GitLab CI/CD uses Docker containers to execute jobs defined in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. By default, if no Docker image is specified, GitLab uses a Ruby-based image. However, modern applications often require specific runtimes or tools—like Node.js and npm for a Node.js application—that aren’t included in the default Ruby image. This guide will walk you through identifying and resolving such issues, with a focus on running a job to check Node.js and npm versions before deploying a Node.js application.

---

## Understanding the Default Behavior in GitLab CI
When you define a job in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file without specifying a Docker image, GitLab CI runs it in the default Ruby-based image.

### Example: Checking Node.js and npm Versions with the Default Image
Let’s assume you want to deploy a Node.js application and need to verify the Node.js and npm versions first. Here’s a basic job:

```yaml
deploy-job:
  script:
    - node -v
    - npm -v
    - echo "Deploying Node.js application"
```

### Problem
When this job runs, it fails with an error like:

```
node: command not found
npm: command not found
```

### Why It Fails
The default Ruby image doesn’t have Node.js or npm installed. Since the job runs inside a Ruby container, it can’t execute Node.js-related commands, resulting in a "command not found" error. This highlights the need to either install Node.js manually or use a different Docker image.

---

## Approach 1: Manually Installing Node.js in the Default Image
One solution is to install Node.js and npm manually within the Ruby image using a `before_script` section.

### Example: Installing Node.js Manually
You can fetch installation commands from a reliable source (e.g., the Node.js website) and add them to your job:

```yaml
deploy-job:
  before_script:
    - |
      curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash -
      apt-get install -y nodejs
  script:
    - node -v
    - npm -v
    - echo "Deploying Node.js application"
```

#### How It Works
- **`before_script`**: Runs before the main `script` section. Here, it:
  1. Downloads and executes the Node.js setup script using `curl`.
  2. Installs Node.js using `apt-get`.
- **Multi-line Command**: The `|` (literal block scalar) in YAML allows multi-line commands to be executed as a single block.

### Challenges
1. **Sudo Issues**: If the original commands include `sudo` (e.g., `sudo apt-get install`), they’ll fail because Docker containers typically don’t have `sudo` installed. You’d need to remove all `sudo` references:
   ```yaml
   before_script:
     - |
       curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash -
       apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```
2. **Time Overhead**: Installing Node.js takes time—around 30 seconds in this case—because it involves downloading and setting up the software every time the job runs.
3. **Hacky Solution**: This approach feels makeshift and isn’t ideal for scalability or maintainability.

### Result
After fixing the `sudo` issue, the job succeeds, outputting something like:
```
node -v: v20.9.0
npm -v: 10.1.0
Deploying Node.js application
```
However, the 30-second delay and manual setup make this less efficient.

---

## Approach 2: Using a Specific Docker Image
A better solution is to use a Docker image that already includes Node.js and npm, avoiding manual installation. In GitLab CI, you can specify a Docker image using the `image` keyword.

### Example: Using a Node.js Docker Image
Modify the job to use a Node.js image from Docker Hub, such as `node:20-alpine3.18`:

```yaml
deploy-job:
  image: node:20-alpine3.18
  script:
    - node -v
    - npm -v
    - echo "Deploying Node.js application"
```

#### How It Works
- **`image: node:20-alpine3.18`**: Specifies that the job should run inside a container based on the `node:20-alpine3.18` image, which includes Node.js 20 and npm pre-installed.
- **No `before_script` Needed**: Since the dependencies are already in the image, no installation is required.

### Result
The job runs successfully and much faster—taking around 13 seconds—because it skips the installation step. Output might look like:
```
node -v: v20.9.0
npm -v: 10.1.0
Deploying Node.js application
```

### Benefits
1. **Speed**: Pre-installed dependencies reduce execution time (13 seconds vs. 30 seconds).
2. **Simplicity**: No need for complex `before_script` commands.
3. **Reliability**: Avoids errors from manual installation (e.g., missing `sudo`).

## Setting a Default Image for All Jobs
If your entire pipeline requires Node.js, you can set a default image for all jobs using the `default` section.

### Example: Default Node.js Image
```yaml
default:
  image: node:20-alpine3.18

deploy-job:
  script:
    - node -v
    - npm -v
    - echo "Deploying Node.js application"

another-job:
  script:
    - echo "This job also uses Node.js"
```

#### How It Works
- **`default` Section**: Applies the `node:20-alpine3.18` image to all jobs unless overridden at the job level.
- **Flexibility**: Individual jobs can still specify a different image if needed.

---

## Choosing the Right Docker Image
- **Source**: Docker Hub (e.g., `node`, `python`) offers official images with various tags (e.g., `node:20`, `node:20-alpine3.18`).
- **Tag Selection**: Use specific tags (e.g., `20-alpine3.18`) for consistency rather than `latest`, which may change over time.
- **Lightweight Images**: Alpine-based images (e.g., `node:20-alpine3.18`) are smaller and faster to pull than full images (e.g., `node:20`).

### Finding Images
Search Docker Hub for “node” and browse tags. For this example, `node:20-alpine3.18` provides Node.js 20 on a lightweight Alpine Linux base.

---

## Advanced `image` Keyword Options
The `image` keyword supports additional configurations:
- **`name`**: Specifies the image name (required).
- **`entrypoint`**: Overrides the container’s default entry point.
- **`pull_policy`**: Controls image pulling behavior (e.g., `always`, `if-not-present`).

### Example: Custom Entrypoint
```yaml
deploy-job:
  image:
    name: node:20-alpine3.18
    entrypoint: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
  script:
    - node -v
    - npm -v
```

#### Explanation
- **`entrypoint`**: Sets the container to use `/bin/sh -c`, allowing shell commands to run directly.

---

## Best Practices
1. **Use Pre-Built Images**: Avoid manual installations for common tools like Node.js, Python, etc.
2. **Minimize Job Time**: Choose lightweight images (e.g., Alpine) to reduce startup time.
3. **Test Locally**: Pull and test Docker images locally (e.g., `docker run -it node:20-alpine3.18`) to ensure they meet your needs.
4. **Document Choices**: Comment your `.gitlab-ci.yml` to explain why a specific image was chosen.

---

## Conclusion
Running jobs within a specific Docker image in GitLab CI is essential for ensuring your pipeline has the right environment. For a Node.js application, using an image like `node:20-alpine3.18` is far more efficient than installing Node.js manually in the default Ruby image. This approach saves time (13 seconds vs. 30 seconds), simplifies configuration, and improves reliability. By mastering the `image` keyword, you can tailor your CI/CD pipeline to any application’s needs effectively.
