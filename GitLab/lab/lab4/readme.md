Below is an in-depth explanation of the GitLab CI/CD pipeline code. Each section of the code is explained step-by-step:



```yaml
# GitLab CI/CD pipeline for the "Solar System NodeJS Pipeline"
# This pipeline runs tests, generates code coverage, builds a Docker image, and publishes it to the GitLab Container Registry.

# Define when the pipeline should run
workflow:
  name: Solar System NodeJS Pipeline                   # Name of the pipeline
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == 'main' || $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH =~ /^feature/
      when: always                                      # Run for commits on main or branches starting with "feature"
    - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME =~ /^feature/ && $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'merge_request_event'
      when: always                                      # Also run for merge requests coming from branches starting with "feature"

# Uncomment the following variables if you want to use global MongoDB settings
# variables:
#   MONGO_URI: 'mongodb+srv://supercluster.d83jj.mongodb.net/superData'
#   MONGO_USERNAME: superuser
#   MONGO_PASSWORD: $M_DB_PASSWORD

### 1. Workflow Configuration

```yaml
workflow:
    name: Solar System NodeJS Pipeline
    rules:
        - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == 'main' || $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH =~ /^feature/
          when: always
        - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME =~ /^feature/ && $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'merge_request_event'
          when: always
```

- **Workflow Name:**  
  The `name` attribute ("Solar System NodeJS Pipeline") provides a descriptive title for the pipeline.

- **Rules:**  
  The `rules` determine under which conditions the pipeline should be triggered:
  - **First Rule:**  
    The pipeline will run when either the branch is `main` or its name starts with `feature` (using a regular expression). This ensures that commits on the main branch or feature branches trigger the pipeline.
  - **Second Rule:**  
    For merge request events, if the source branch of the merge request starts with `feature`, the pipeline will also be executed.  
  These rules allow you to control the execution of your pipeline based on branch names and pipeline events, helping to prevent unnecessary builds.

### 2. (Commented Out) Global Variables

```yaml
#variables:
#  MONGO_URI: 'mongodb+srv://supercluster.d83jj.mongodb.net/superData'
#  MONGO_USERNAME: superuser
#  MONGO_PASSWORD: $M_DB_PASSWORD
```

- **Purpose:**  
  These commented-out variables represent connection details for a MongoDB database (possibly a production instance). When uncommented, they would be globally available to all jobs.
- **Usage:**  
  Typically, such variables help in managing environment-specific settings securely (with sensitive data often being stored as masked CI/CD variables).

---

### 3. Stages

```yaml
stages:
  - test
  - containerization
```

- **Stages Overview:**  
  Stages define the sequence in which jobs run:
  - **Test Stage:**  
    Jobs under this stage (like `unit_testing` and `code_coverage`) are executed first.
  - **Containerization Stage:**  
    After testing, jobs such as building and publishing the Docker container are executed.
- **Parallelism:**  
  Within a stage, jobs run concurrently (if there are available runners). The next stage starts only after all jobs in the previous stage have completed successfully (unless jobs are allowed to fail).

---

### 4. Unit Testing Job

```yaml
unit_testing:
  stage: test
  image: node:17-alpine3.14
  services:
    - name: siddharth67/mongo-db:non-prod
      alias: mongo
      pull_policy: always
  variables:
    MONGO_URI: mongodb://mongo:27017/superData
    MONGO_USERNAME: non-prod-user
    MONGO_PASSWORD: non-prod-password
  before_script:
    - npm install
  script:
    - npm test
  cache:
    policy: pull-push
    key:
        files:
          - package-lock.json
        prefix: kk-lab-node-modules
    paths:
      - node_modules
  artifacts:
    name: Mocha-Test-Result
    when: on_success
    paths:
      - test-results.xml
    expire_in: 3 days 
```

- **Job Basics:**  
  This job is part of the `test` stage and uses the official Node.js image (`node:17-alpine3.14`), ensuring a lightweight and consistent environment.
  
- **Services:**  
  - A MongoDB service (`siddharth67/mongo-db:non-prod`) is started alongside the job.  
  - The service is aliased as `mongo` so that the application can refer to it using this name.  
  - The `pull_policy: always` ensures the latest version of the service image is used.

- **Job-Specific Variables:**  
  Environment variables (like `MONGO_URI`, `MONGO_USERNAME`, and `MONGO_PASSWORD`) are set to allow the application to connect to the MongoDB service. Here, `MONGO_URI` points to the local service (`mongodb://mongo:27017/superData`).

- **before_script:**  
  Runs `npm install` to install all dependencies before executing the tests.

- **script:**  
  Executes `npm test` to run the unit tests of the application.

- **Cache:**  
  - Caches the `node_modules` directory to speed up subsequent pipeline runs.  
  - The cache key is based on `package-lock.json`, ensuring the cache is updated when dependencies change.

- **Artifacts:**  
  - The test results (`test-results.xml`) are stored as artifacts, which can be reviewed later.  
  - Artifacts are kept for 3 days and are only uploaded if the job succeeds.

### 5. Code Coverage Job

```yaml
code_coverage:
  stage: test
  image: node:17-alpine3.14
  services:
    - name: siddharth67/mongo-db:non-prod
      alias: mongo
      pull_policy: always
  variables:
    MONGO_URI: mongodb://mongo:27017/superData
    MONGO_USERNAME: non-prod-user
    MONGO_PASSWORD: non-prod-password
  before_script:
    - npm install
  cache:
    policy: pull
    key:
        files:
          - package-lock.json
        prefix: kk-lab-node-modules
    paths:
      - node_modules
  script: |
    npm run coverage
  artifacts:
    name: Lab3-Code-Coverage-Result
    reports:
      coverage_report:
        coverage_format: cobertura
        path: coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml
  allow_failure: true
```

- **Purpose:**  
  This job is also in the `test` stage and is similar to the unit testing job but focuses on generating a code coverage report.

- **Execution:**  
  - Uses the same Node.js image and MongoDB service as the unit testing job.  
  - Installs dependencies and then runs `npm run coverage` to generate code coverage information.

- **Cache:**  
  Uses the same caching mechanism to reuse installed dependencies.

- **Artifacts:**  
  - Generates a coverage report in Cobertura format, stored at `coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml`.  
  - This report can be consumed by various CI/CD tools to visualize code coverage.

- **Allow Failure:**  
  The `allow_failure: true` setting means that if this job fails (for example, if the coverage script has issues), the pipeline will not be marked as failed. This is useful when code coverage is informative rather than a strict gatekeeper for deployment.

---

### 6. Docker Build Job

```yaml
docker_build:
  stage: containerization
  needs: ["unit_testing","code_coverage"]
  image: docker:24.0.5
  services: 
    - name: docker:24.0.5-dind    
  script:
    - chmod +x scripts/docker_build.sh
    - ./scripts/docker_build.sh
  artifacts:
    paths: 
      - image/
    when: on_success
```

- **Stage & Dependencies:**  
  - This job is in the `containerization` stage and depends on the completion of both `unit_testing` and `code_coverage` jobs (specified by `needs`).

- **Environment:**  
  - Uses a Docker image (`docker:24.0.5`) to run Docker commands.  
  - The job leverages Docker-in-Docker (`docker:24.0.5-dind`), allowing the pipeline to build Docker images within the CI environment.

- **Script:**  
  - Changes the permissions of the `docker_build.sh` script to ensure it is executable.  
  - Executes the script to build the Docker image.
  
- **Artifacts:**  
  - The built Docker image is saved in the `image/` directory as an artifact.  
  - Artifacts here allow the next job to use the built image.

---

### 7. Publish to GitLab Container Registry

```yaml
publish_gitlab_container_registry:
  stage: containerization
  needs: ["docker_build"]
  image: docker:24.0.5
  services: 
    - name: docker:24.0.5-dind
  script:
    - docker load -i image/solar-system-image-$CI_PIPELINE_ID.tar
    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY
    - docker tag solar-system:$CI_PIPELINE_ID $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/solar-system:$CI_PIPELINE_ID
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/solar-system:$CI_PIPELINE_ID
```

- **Dependencies:**  
  This job runs after `docker_build` (specified by `needs`), ensuring that the Docker image is available.

- **Environment & Services:**  
  - Continues to use the Docker image and Docker-in-Docker service for executing Docker commands.

- **Script Actions:**  
  - **Load the Image:**  
    Loads the Docker image from the artifact tarball created in the previous job.
  - **Login to Registry:**  
    Uses CI/CD variables (`$CI_REGISTRY_USER`, `$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`, `$CI_REGISTRY`) to authenticate with GitLab’s Container Registry.
  - **Tagging:**  
    Tags the Docker image with a name that includes the pipeline ID, ensuring versioning and traceability.
  - **Pushing:**  
    Pushes the tagged image to the GitLab Container Registry so it can be deployed or used by other services.

---

### Summary

- **Workflow & Rules:**  
  Control when the pipeline runs based on branch names and merge request events.
  
- **Stages & Jobs:**  
  The pipeline is divided into stages: testing and containerization. Within these, jobs are defined to run unit tests, generate coverage reports, build a Docker image, and finally publish that image to a container registry.
  
- **Services, Variables, and Caching:**  
  - Services allow the pipeline to spin up additional containers (e.g., MongoDB) needed for testing.
  - Variables manage environment-specific settings.
  - Caching speeds up the pipeline by reusing dependencies between jobs.
  
- **Artifacts:**  
  Artifacts store important outputs (like test results, coverage reports, and built images) so they can be reviewed later or used in subsequent stages.

This detailed breakdown covers every major aspect of the pipeline configuration, explaining how each component works together to automate testing, building, and deploying a Node.js application within a GitLab CI/CD environment.
