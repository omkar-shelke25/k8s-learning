In GitLab CI/CD, the `dependencies` keyword is used in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to specify which artifacts from previous jobs should be passed to the current job. This is useful when you want to share files or data between jobs in a pipeline.

### Key Points About `dependencies`

1. **Artifacts**: The `dependencies` keyword is used to control which artifacts from upstream jobs are downloaded and made available to the current job.
2. **Default Behavior**: By default, all artifacts from all previous stages are passed to the current job. You can use `dependencies` to limit this behavior.
3. **No Artifacts**: If you set `dependencies: []`, no artifacts will be passed to the job, even if they were created in previous stages.

### Example Usage

Here’s an example of how to use the `dependencies` keyword in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the application..."
    - echo "Build artifacts" > build-output.txt
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - build-output.txt

test_job:
  stage: test
  dependencies:
    - build_job
  script:
    - echo "Testing the application..."
    - cat build-output.txt

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  dependencies: []  # No artifacts from previous jobs
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the application..."
```

### Explanation

1. **`build_job`**:
   - Runs in the `build` stage.
   - Creates an artifact (`build-output.txt`).
   - The artifact is passed to the next stage by default.

2. **`test_job`**:
   - Runs in the `test` stage.
   - Explicitly depends on the `build_job` using the `dependencies` keyword.
   - Accesses the `build-output.txt` artifact created by `build_job`.

3. **`deploy_job`**:
   - Runs in the `deploy` stage.
   - Uses `dependencies: []` to ensure no artifacts are passed to this job, even if they were created in previous stages.

### When to Use `dependencies`

- **Selective Artifact Passing**: Use `dependencies` when you want to selectively pass artifacts from specific jobs rather than all jobs in previous stages.
- **Optimization**: If a job doesn’t need artifacts from previous jobs, setting `dependencies: []` can improve performance by reducing unnecessary artifact downloads.

### Important Notes

- The `dependencies` keyword only works for jobs in **earlier stages**. You cannot depend on jobs in the same or later stages.
- If a job listed in `dependencies` fails or is skipped, the dependent job will not run unless you explicitly allow it using the `allow_failure` or `needs` keyword.

### Advanced: `needs` Keyword

In modern GitLab CI/CD, the `needs` keyword is often used instead of `dependencies` for more fine-grained control over job dependencies. `needs` allows you to define dependencies between jobs regardless of their stage, enabling parallel execution and faster pipelines.

Example with `needs`:

```yaml
test_job:
  stage: test
  needs:
    - build_job
  script:
    - echo "Testing the application..."
    - cat build-output.txt
```

This allows `test_job` to start as soon as `build_job` completes, even if other jobs in the `build` stage are still running.
