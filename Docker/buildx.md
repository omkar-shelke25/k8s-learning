### Command
```
docker buildx build \
  --cache-from type=local,src=/tmp/.buildx-cache \
  --cache-to type=local,dest=/tmp/.buildx-cache-new,mode=max \
  -t noteapp-nginx:latest ./nginx \
  --load
```

---

### Purpose
Builds a Docker image (`noteapp-nginx:latest`) from the `nginx/` directory, using caching to save time by reusing previous work and storing new results for future builds.

---

### Example Dockerfile
Let’s assume `nginx/Dockerfile` is:
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest
COPY config.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/
RUN echo "Hello" > /hello.txt
```
- **Layer 1**: Base image (`nginx:latest`).
- **Layer 2**: Copy config file.
- **Layer 3**: Create a text file.

### Notes on Each Part

1. **`docker buildx build`**:
   - Advanced Docker build tool.
   - Supports caching and multi-platform builds (unlike plain `docker build`).
   - Used here to build the `noteapp-nginx` image.

2. **`--cache-from type=local,src=/tmp/.buildx-cache`**:
   - **What it does**: Loads cached layers from `/tmp/.buildx-cache`.
   - **Type=local**: Cache is stored on the local filesystem (not a remote registry).
   - **Src=/tmp/.buildx-cache**: Folder with cached layers from the last build.
   - **In the example**: 
     - If you ran this before, it reuses the cached `nginx:latest` download, `config.conf` copy, etc., if they haven’t changed.
   - **Why**: Speeds up builds by skipping unchanged steps.

3. **`--cache-to type=local,dest=/tmp/.buildx-cache-new,mode=max`**:
   - **What it does**: Saves new build layers to `/tmp/.buildx-cache-new`.
   - **Type=local**: Stores cache locally.
   - **Dest=/tmp/.buildx-cache-new**: Temporary folder for the new cache (later moved to replace the old one).
   - **Mode=max**: Saves all layers (base image, copies, runs), not just the final image. More space, faster future builds.
   - **In the example**: 
     - After building, all three layers (`FROM`, `COPY`, `RUN`) are saved, even if only one changed.
   - **Why**: Ensures the next build can reuse as much as possible.

4. **`-t noteapp-nginx:latest`**:
   - **What it does**: Tags the image as `noteapp-nginx:latest`.
   - **In the example**: 
     - The final image (nginx + config + "Hello" file) gets this name.
   - **Why**: Makes it easy to identify and use later (e.g., `docker save`).

5. **`./nginx`**:
   - **What it does**: Points to the `nginx/` folder with the Dockerfile and files (like `config.conf`).
   - **In the example**: 
     - Builds using the Dockerfile and `config.conf` in that folder.
   - **Why**: Tells Docker where the "recipe" and ingredients are.

6. **`--load`**:
   - **What it does**: Loads the built image into the local Docker daemon.
   - **In the example**: 
     - Makes `noteapp-nginx:latest` available for `docker save` in your workflow.
   - **Why**: Lets you use the image right away (instead of just building it).

---

### How Caching Works
- **Layers**: Each Dockerfile line creates a layer (e.g., `FROM`, `COPY`, `RUN`).
- **Hash Check**: Docker hashes each layer (command + file contents):
  - Same hash as cache → Reuse it.
  - Different hash → Rebuild it and layers after it.
- **Example**:
  - Change `config.conf`:
    - Layer 1 (`FROM`) reused from cache.
    - Layer 2 (`COPY`) rebuilt (new file).
    - Layer 3 (`RUN`) rebuilt (depends on Layer 2).
  - New cache saved with old Layer 1 + new Layers 2 and 3.

---

### In Your Workflow
- **First Run**: No cache in `/tmp/.buildx-cache`, builds all layers, saves to `/tmp/.buildx-cache-new`.
- **Next Run**: 
  - Loads cache from `/tmp/.buildx-cache`.
  - Builds only changed layers.
  - Saves updated cache to `/tmp/.buildx-cache-new`.
- **Cache Move**: Later step moves `-new` to replace the old cache.

---

### Benefits
- **Speed**: Reuses unchanged layers (e.g., `nginx:latest` download takes seconds instead of minutes).
- **Efficiency**: Only rebuilds what’s necessary.
- **GitHub Actions**: Cache persists across runs via `actions/cache`, saving time on CI/CD.

---

### Quick Visual
- **No Change**:  
  Cache → Reuse all → Build in 10s.  
- **Change `config.conf`**:  
  Cache → Reuse `FROM` → Rebuild `COPY` + `RUN` → Build in 20s.  
- **No Cache**:  
  Build everything → 60s.
